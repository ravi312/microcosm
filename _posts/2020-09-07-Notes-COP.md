## Introduction

- rethinking of the notion of learning 
	- mind, culture, history, and the social as interrelated processes that constitute each other
	- Learning is neither wholly subjective nor fully encompassed in social interaction, and it is not constituted separately from the social world
	- learning is recognized as a social phenomenon constituted in the experienced, lived-in world, through legitimate peripheral participation in ongoing social practice
	- the process of changing knowledgeable skill is subsumed in processes of changing identity in and through membership in a community of practitioners;
	-  mastery is an organizational, relational characteristic of communities of practice.
	-  mastery comes without didactic structuring and in such a fashion that knowledgeable skill is part of the construction of new identities of mastery in practice.

## sociocultural character of social reproduction for both persons and communities of practice

- What are the typical communities of practice?
- What and how do people learn as legitimate peripheral participants
- How is this arranged in the socially organized settings of everyday practice?
- What can we learn from examining contemporary social practice when it is conceived as a complex structure of interrelated processes of production and transformation of communities and participants?

## Challenges with formal educational sites

- difficult to identify communities of practice, widespread mastery, traditions of centripetal participation leading to changing identities of mastery
- How a socially situated theory of learning reveals the problematic character social-institutional arrangements of schools and workplaces that are intended to bring about learning in the world in which we live? 


## Theoretical approaches to situated activity

- **cognition plus view**
	- social factors become conditions whose effects on individual cognition are then explored
	- cognitive processes & features of situations as treated as situated entities
	- analytic meaning is predicated on a radical disjunction between them
	- engaged in linear communication of "information" without integral relations of power and control (Rommetveit, 1987)

- **interpretive view** (analysis of interested negotiated meaning in social interaction)
	- meaning is negotiated, the use of language is a social activity rather than a matter of individual transmission of information
	- situated cognition is interest-relative
	- locates situatedness in the use of language and/or social interaction
	- individuals have perspectivally unique experience
	- the world is not fixed as in the cognitive first approach

> - Rommetveit proposes that the cognition plus and interpretive positions, disagreeing with each other are converging
> - hermeneutic view of situated meaning
> - bracketing off of the social world as an object to study (negating the possibility that subjects are fundamentally constituted in their relations with and activities in that world)

- **situated social practice view**
	- emphasizes the relational interdependency of agent and world, activity, meaning, cognition, learning, and knowing
	- learning, thinking, and knowing are relations among people engaged in activity in, with, and arising from the socially and culturally structured world. This world is itself socially constituted. 
	- situates learning in social practice in the lived-in world


> - dialectical relations between the social world and persons engaged in the activity; together these produce and re-produce both world and persons in activity
> - How to translate this into a specific analytic approach to learning?

## Learning as legitimate peripheral participants

- Legitimate peripheral participation offers a two-way bridge between the development of knowledgeable skill and identity, the production of persons and the production and reproduction of communities of practice. 
- Newcomers become old timers through a social process of increasingly centripetal participation, which depends on legitimate access to ongoing community pracrice
- Newcomers develop a changing undersranding of practice over time from improvised opportunities to participate peripherally in ongoing activities of the community
- Master don't have a direct, didactic impact on apprentices' learning
activity (hence differ from teacher/pupil)
- no external tests and little praise or blame
- progress being visible to the learner and others in the process of work itself
- access for the apprentice to ongoing work and participation
- Apprentices have the opportunity to see community pracrice in its complexity early -> the apprentice makes her or his own curriculum-> individualized and realistic learning setting

> **Changing relationship of newcomers to ongoing activity**
> The process of becoming a full practitioner through increasingly intense, interconnected, and 'knowledgeably-skilled" participation, on the one hand, and the organization of processes of work, on the other hand, do not generally coincide at levels at which activity is intentionally organized. It follows that learners' perspectives on work will be different, and their comprehension of the practice will change across the process of learning. ??

- Butchers (Marshell, 1972) specializing in short, repetitive task; puts apprentices where they can work most efficiently
> - Economics, efficiency, control over the intensiry and uniformity of labor, segregation of interrelated activitizs in space and time, diminish or enhance access
> - exploitation of apprentices as sources of free or cheap labor

- Yucatec Mayan Midwifery (Jordan, 1989)
	- more effective and less exploitive 
	- have access to both broad knowledgeability about the practice or midwifery and to increasing participation in that practice
	- Apprenticeship happens as a way of, and in the course of daily life 	- lack of intentional guidance and instruction makes learning difficult(Becker)
	- Lave argues that there are resources other than teaching through which newcomers grow into oldtimers' knowledge and skill.
		- Broad exposure to ongoing practice
		- more inclusive process of generating identities (notion that knowledge and skill develop in the process)
		- No grouping into learners still the the learning takes in distributed organic fashion

> What are the characteristic of communities of practice that reproduce themselves successfully?

- AA (Cain, 1991)
	- CoP newcomers gradually develop identities as nondrinking alcoholics
	- oldtimers give testimony about their drinking past and the course of the process of becoming sober
	- reconstruction of identity, through the process of construction of these life stories

Historical analysis, communities, and Cognition  
~ The process of becoming a full practitioner in a community of practice involves two kinds of production: the production of continuity with, and the displacement of, the practice of oldtimers (Lave & Wenger, 1991) Newcomers and oldtimers are dependent on each other; construction of practitioners' identities is a collective enterprise. Without participation with others, there may be no basis for lived identity

## Why is learning problematic in the modern world?

- conditions for learning in contemporary society limit the possibility of mastery
- Alienation (Marxist social theory)
	- To commoditize labour, knowledge, and participation in communities of practice is to diminish possibilities for the sustained development of identities of mastery.
	- It is difficult to move from peripheral to full participation in today's world (including workplaces and schools), thereby developing knowledgeably skilled identities. 
- Schools as sites for the production of elite knowledge disjointed from the everyday activity ( vocational - formal divide)
- Schools and school-like workplace educational enterprises accord knowledgeable skill a reified existence, turning it into something to be "acquired" and its transmission into an institutionai motive
	- **generation of negatively valued identities**
	- **formation of ad hoc, interstitial nature of communities of practice**


>- separate identity from intended forms of knowledgeable practice
>- truncate both the movement from peripheral to full participation 
>- limit the scope of knowledgeable skill

## Conclusion

### How communities of practice and cultural processes of identity construction shape each other ?

- conceptual interdependencies among person, activity, knowledge, world that recommends a conception of learning as "legitimate peripheral participation in the communities of practise"
- Lave argued that relations between subjects and objects in the world are shaped by their cultural and historical circumstances in processes that involve the subjectification of objects and the objectification of persons, and that often generate negative identities and ad hoc communities of practice.
- this offers means with which to replace an unproblematic notion of cultural transmission/internalization with a historically situated analysis of relations among activity, the social world, and persons in practice.
- Objectifying persons and the personalizing of commodities are situated principles of thought and interpretation. as well as structural principles in the formation of communities of practice.


- need to understand interrelations of communities; formation of valued identities of mastery through legitimate peripheral participation
- there is a great deal to be learned about communities of practice and the community's knowledgeable skill in schools and workplaces that cannot be learned if institutional boundaries and programs are assumed to define the lived character of social practice
- communities make possible certain kinds of transformations of 
understanding, identity, and knowledgeable skill

#### What are the conditions that make deep transformations possible? (newcomers becoming oldtimers)

- near peers relations (facilitate sharing of knowledgeable skill)
- exemplar master
