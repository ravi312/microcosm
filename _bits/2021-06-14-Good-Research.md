We resonate with the qualitative methodologist Robert E. Stake (1995), who muses, “Good research is not about good methods as much as it is about good thinking” (p. 19). Good thinking means to look for and find patterns in the data. Good thinking means to construct substantial categories from an array of codes. Good thinking means to transcend the localness of a particular case to find its generalizability and transferability to other contexts. Research methods are excellent tools, but they are only as good as the craftsperson who uses them. (Miles et al., 2014)
